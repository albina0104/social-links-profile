## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- `<nav>` HTML element can be used for a set of navigational links.
- I converted all `px` sizes to `rem`, but somehow my result did not match the design. Turned out, the reason was that I set a root font size as 14px. I did it only to set the default font size for the text, without thinking that it would affect sizes of everything since it's all in `rem`. So I removed the root font size, and set font size only for the elements that need it.
